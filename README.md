below you can find each instruction that was given as a user. You can follow each version of the output in the git history

**User**

Create an html / js page to play a game of ultimate tic tac toe with two people

Place 9 tic tac toe boards (each 3x3 fields) organized in 3 rows and 3 cells.

**User**

apply the following rules:

the first player can play on any board and click any cell afterwards each player can only play on the board, that is defined by the previously selected cell. For example, if the cell is in row 1, column 2, the next player needs to select a cell on the board in row 1, column 2. Only if that board was already won by someone, or if no legal moves are possible anymore, then the player may select a cell on any board

Highlight the boards that are allowed to be player by the current player in red

**User**

highlightAllowedBoards does not work. All boards are highlighted all the time

**User**

If a board is won, replace it with a huge X or O depending on the player that won. Remove the alert if a player won on a single board.

Instead a player wins, if he is able to win three boards in a row, column or diagonally, just like the 9 boards form the cell of a bigger tic tac toe field

**User**

On the top of the page, show a highlighted X or O depending on the current player

**User**

update the css rule for .winner. The background should be white and the X or O should be centered in the surrounding div

**User**

the css rule ".board-container" should not contain "display: grid" if the board was already won

**User**

finally, if a board was drawn (no winner), replace it with the ".winner" style as well, however leave it empty (do not show a big X or O)

**User**

create a background image that we can add to the page to look a little nicer. Add a header as well, just containing "Ultimate Tic Tac Toe" and a small reset button to restart the game

**User**

Change the red color of the current player, board and reset button to #e64ec0
